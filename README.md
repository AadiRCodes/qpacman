# qpacman

This is a project I completed in CS 188 (Introduction to Artificial Intelligence) at UC Berkeley. It involves using reinforcement learning to train different agents, including a Pacman agent to play Pacman against ghost. It uses an approximate linear Q-learning function made up of a linear combination of features.
